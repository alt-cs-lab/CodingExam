# CodingExam
Instructions for setting up the development environment can be found in the "Developer Documentation" file in the "documentation-testing" folder.

# Documentation
User and developer documentation for this sprint can be found in the "documentation-testing" folder as well.
Additionally, our customer asked us to research a syntax aware text editor, and our findings were put into the file titled "Ace Code-Editor Research" in the "documentation-testing" folder as well.

# Testing
For testing, the server application contains unit tests which can be run by navigating to the "server" folder and running the command "npm test". These unit tests should be run after the database has been created as detailed in the development environment setup instructions. For the client application, due to how the state of the props are currently tracked making unit testing ineffective, we have included a test plan titled "Client Testing Plan", which can be found in the "documentation-testing" folder.
