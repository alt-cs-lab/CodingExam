# CodingExam
In this release, the app is still early in development, so it has been marked as pre-release. Instructions for setting up the development environment can be found in the "Developer Documentation" file in the "documentation-testing" folder. This includes how to initialize the database, install needed libraries, start the application, and have the application display in Canvas through an HTTPS proxy.

# Documentation
User and developer documentation for this sprint can be found in the "documentation-testing" folder as well.
Additionally, our customer asked us to research Parsons Problems for a future sprint, and our findings were put into the file titled "Parsons Problems React Library Research" in the "documentation-testing" folder as well.

# Testing
For testing, the both the client and the server application contain unit tests which can be run by navigating to the appropriate folder ("client" or "server") and running the command "npm test". These unit tests should be run after the database has been created as detailed in the development environment setup instructions.

For the client testing, the unit tests only test that the components are rendering properly. To test the functionality of the components for the Student and Instructor views, testing plans have been included in the "documentation-testing" folder as well.
