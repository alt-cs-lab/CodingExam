# CodingExam
In this release, the app is still early in development, so it has been marked as pre-release. Instructions for setting up the development environment can be found in the "Developer Documentation" file in the "documentation-testing" folder. This includes how to set up the docker installation, start the application in development, and have the application display in Canvas through an HTTPS proxy. Additionally, a "ResetDatabaseScript.sql" file has been included in the "database" folder if the database needs to be reset in development mode.

# Research/Prototypes
For this sprint, we were also tasked with researching and prototyping a design for the GUI for the grading component of the application. The designs can be found in the "CodingExamGradingGUIDesigns_Sprint7" file in the "documentation-testing" folder.

# Documentation
User and developer documentation for this sprint can be found in the "documentation-testing" folder as well.

# Testing
For testing, the server application contain unit tests which can be run by navigating to the "server" folder and running the command "npm test". These unit tests should be run after the application has been run once as per the development environment setup instructions.

For the client testing, to test the functionality of the components for the Student and Instructor views, testing plans have been included in the "documentation-testing" folder as well. Additionally, the User Documentation can also be used to supplement the testing plans, as it walks the user through most of the application's functionality.
